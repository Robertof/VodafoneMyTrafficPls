This is Vodafone Traffic Retriever (or Vodafone, my traffic pls).
It allows you to get the used traffic of your Vodafone Internet Key from http://contatori.vodafone.it.
Available features are:
- automatic updating of data each X seconds/minutes/hours/days
- statistics of used traffic (calculated with subtracting traffic used now and traffic used when the application was started)
- plan informations (total GiBs available, what happens when you reach the quota, etc..)
- a nice progressbar which shows how much traffic you've used, what's nicer?

Actually I wrote this using NetBeans (with its GUI creation). I actually removed all the directories except 'src' (which contains the sourcecode) and 'dist' (which contains the compiled jar).
If anyone needs the full project, tell me.

This program is actually in Italian. English translation could be added if requested (but I don't think so - it works only in Italy so.. lol)
You don't need any dependencies for this. Just javac every piece of code, and you're okay (or just use the jar / the compiled class files in it)

Have fun
